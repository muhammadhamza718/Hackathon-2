# ADR-0003: Technology Stack Selection Phase 2

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-11
- **Feature:** 001-init-project-arch
- **Context:** Need for a high-performance, modern full-stack solution that can be effectively maintained by an AI agent with strong typing and modern development practices.

<!-- Significance checklist (ALL must be true to justify this ADR)
     1) Impact: Long-term consequence for architecture/platform/security?
     2) Alternatives: Multiple viable options considered with tradeoffs?
     3) Scope: Cross-cutting concern (not an isolated detail)?
     If any are false, prefer capturing as a PHR note instead of an ADR. -->

## Decision

Use Next.js 16+ (App Router) for Frontend, FastAPI + SQLModel for Backend, and Neon Serverless for Database. This stack provides type safety, modern UX patterns, and flexible schema management while being well-suited for AI-assisted development.

- Frontend Framework: Next.js 16+ with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Backend Framework: FastAPI with Python 3.11+, Pydantic v2 for type validation
- Database ORM: SQLModel for unified data modeling between Pydantic and SQLAlchemy
- Database Provider: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL for auto-scaling and branch capabilities
- Authentication: Better Auth with JWT Plugin for cross-service authentication
- Testing: Jest/React Testing Library for frontend, pytest for backend

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong type safety through TypeScript frontend and Pydantic backend
- Modern UX with Server Components, Server Actions, and streaming capabilities
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading and integrated tooling
- Auto-scaling database with Neon's serverless features
- Comprehensive API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI
- Flexible data modeling with SQLModel's unified approach
- Built-in security features with Better Auth
- Modern styling with Tailwind CSS utility-first approach

### Negative

- Requires maintaining two separate language runtimes (JavaScript/TypeScript and Python)
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with both ecosystems
- Potential complexity in deployment and CI/CD with multiple runtimes
- Dependency on specific framework features that may change over time
- Different package management systems (npm/yarn vs pip)

## Alternatives Considered

Alternative A: Full TypeScript stack (Next.js + Node.js/Express + Prisma)
- Why rejected: Backend would lack some of the performance and developer experience benefits of FastAPI
- Would miss out on Python ecosystem's strengths in data processing and AI integration

Alternative B: React + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL
- Why rejected: More complex setup, less modern tooling compared to chosen stack
- Would lose benefits of Next.js App Router and integrated deployment

Alternative C: SvelteKit + FastAPI + SQLModel
- Why rejected: SvelteKit has smaller community and fewer resources compared to Next.js ecosystem
- Next.js has better integration with Vercel for deployment and more mature ecosystem
